# Civil engineering meets AI : Using drones to reimagine traffic management

## Introduction 
As third-year civil engineering students, we were tasked with conducting a bachelor project in one of the key areas of our field. Together with two classmates, I chose to focus on transportation - specifically exploring how technology can help address the challenges of urban traffic. 

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in cities worlwide. Even minor disruptions can paralyze entire areas, while traditional monitoring methods are costly, require maintenance and are too static to adapt to real-time conditions. 

Drones present a flexible and cost-effective alternative. With their mobility and ability to capture high-resolution data, drones can quickly monitor traffic flow, react to incidents as well as providing valuable insights for smarter traffic management. 

This project simulates a simplified city grid where zones of congestion cyclically light up, representing perturbations in the transportation network. A fleet of drones is tasked with monitoring these zones using algorithms we designed and tested. Our approach includes : 
  * Urban Environment simulation  : A grid-based city where importance zones light up cyclically (big perturbations follow an exponential     function while small perturbations who tend to re-appear follow a sinusoidal function).
  * Rule-based algorithms : Pre-defined logic guiding drone decisions.
  * Efficiency evaluation : Different metrics to measure each algorithm performance.
  * Patrolling behavior : Ensuring drones cover the city continuously, not just reacting to one zone.
  * Reinforcment learning : Moving beyond simple rule-based algorithms to adaptive strategies tahat learn from patterns and improve over time.

 Our ultimate goal is to explore how drones could support real-time, adaptive traffic monitoring in complex urban environments.
