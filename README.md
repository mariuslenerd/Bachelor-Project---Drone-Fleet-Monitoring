# Civil engineering meets AI : Using drones to reimagine traffic management

## Introduction 
As third-year civil engineering students, we were tasked with conducting a bachelor project in one of the key areas of our field. Together with two classmates, I chose to focus on transportation - specifically exploring how technology can help address the challenges of urban traffic. 

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in cities worlwide. Even minor disruptions can paralyze entire areas, while traditional monitoring methods are costly, require maintenance and are too static to adapt to real-time conditions. 

Drones present a flexible and cost-effective alternative. With their mobility and ability to capture high-resolution data, drones can quickly monitor traffic flow, react to incidents as well as providing valuable insights for smarter traffic management. 

This project simulates a simplified city grid where zones of congestion cyclically light up, representing perturbations in the transportation network. A fleet of drones is tasked with monitoring these zones using algorithms we designed and tested. Our approach includes : 
   * \textbf{Urban Environment simulation} : A grid-based city where importance zones light up cyclically (big perturbations follow an exponential function while small perturbations who tend to re-appear follow a sinusoidal function).
   * Rule-based algorithms : Pre-defined logic guiding drone decisions.
   * Efficiency
