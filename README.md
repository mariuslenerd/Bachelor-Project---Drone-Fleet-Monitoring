# Bachelor-Project---Drone-Fleet-Monitoring
This project explores the design, optimization, and autonomous control of a multi-drone system for civil transportation monitoring. Leveraging reinforcement learning, the goal is to create a fleet of drones that can coordinate their activities, adapt to dynamic environments, and perform tasks with minimal human intervention.
